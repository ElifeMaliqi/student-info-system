# Future Minds Academy - SIS Project Context

## Registration Modes
The system supports two distinct modes for student registration:

1. **Administrator Registration (Manual)**
   - Administrators can manually add students from the admin dashboard.
   - They fill in the student's details (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Parent's Phone, Program, Gender) and upload necessary documents.
   - The student is immediately added to the system (status can be Active or Pending based on admin choice).

2. **Student Self-Registration (Online)**
   - Students can apply for admission through the public-facing portal.
   - After submitting their application and documents, they are placed in a "Waiting Room" state.
   - They will see a dedicated page stating: "You're under review from administrators."
   - Administrators will review these applications in the dashboard and approve/reject them. Upon approval, the student gains full access to the Student Dashboard.
